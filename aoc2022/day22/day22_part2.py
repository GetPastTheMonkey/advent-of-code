# The whole code assumes that the cube has the following layout
# Top: 0, Front: 1, Right: 2, Back: 3, Left: 4, Bottom: 5
# The actual position on the grid is entered into the cube list but in
# contrast to the default layout the very left top row is on side 0 (Top)

# SIZE      contains the size of one side (either 4 or 50)
# cube      denotes the (x, y) start position of each side
# rotation  The top side (0) is always assumed to not be rotated the
#           entries take values from 1 to 3 and (1 denotes 90Â° clockwise)
#             4 0 2 This (default) grid would have rotation 0 for all cubes       
#               1   -> But note that if the input actually had this shape
#               5      we would label the sides differently and 
#               3      ->  the values in rotation differ too

# Example values for cube and side_rot for the example input
# cube = [(0, 8), (4, 8), (8, 12), (4, 0), (4, 4), (8, 8)]
# side_rot = [0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0]

# The entry in [i][j] = a, b denotes that if we leave side i in direction j
# we enter side "a" in direction "b" (right (0), down (1), left (2), up (3))
# -> here we assume the (default) layout from above (all rotations = 0)
